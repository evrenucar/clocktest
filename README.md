# 24 Hour Clock Loader

This is a simple web app that displays a 24-hour clock as a loading bar. The bar fills from left to right over the course of a day. A live digital clock is shown above the bar. Each hour is marked below the bar, and the marks (and numbers) at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 are larger for better readability.

Open `index.html` in your browser to see the clock in action. To share it publicly, push the files to a GitHub repository and enable GitHub Pages for that repo.
