# 24 Hour Clock Loader

Public version can be accessed at https://evrenucar.github.io/clocktest/

This is a simple web app that displays a 24-hour clock as a loading bar. The bar fills from left to right over the course of a day. A live digital clock is shown above the bar. Each hour is marked below the bar from 0 through 24. The marks (and numbers) at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 are twice the size for better readability and the 0/24 markers sit flush with the edges.

Open `index.html` in your browser to see the clock in action. To share it publicly, push the files to a GitHub repository and enable GitHub Pages for that repo.
