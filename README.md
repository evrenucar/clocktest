# 24 Hour Clock Loader

Public version can be accessed at https://evrenucar.github.io/clocktest/

This is a simple web app that displays a 24-hour clock as a loading bar. The bar fills from left to right over the course of a day. 
Unlike a regular clock a progress-bar helps visualize passage of time and how much time is left in the day.

Sound help to recognize and perceive passage of time better. Sound to be played can be selected and volume adjusted

The night filter can be adjusted to pull whites closer to yellow for less eye-strain
